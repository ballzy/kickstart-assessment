      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to the website using a screen reader (including the most recent version of JAWS)</li>
